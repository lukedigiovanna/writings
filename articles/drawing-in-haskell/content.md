Haskell is a general purpose, functional programming language which most people
don't jump to when wanting to write graphical applications, but that doesn't
make it impossible! I find the functional paradigm quite fun to program in,
though I have mostly stuck with procedural languages and stuck in 
functional components whenever I can (e.g. `map` in Python).

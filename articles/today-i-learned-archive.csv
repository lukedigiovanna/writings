11/13/2024: There is a method to factor integers using multiples of points on elliptic curves over modular rings - similar to Pollard’s p-1 algorithm. Bizarre how that can fall out of something seemingly so abstract.
11/14/2024: any 2D map of regions can be colored such that adjacent regions are different using no more than 4 colors. This can proved by showing the chromatic number of the dual graph of any planar graph is at most 4. The proof handles so many cases that it’s infeasible without software!
11/15/2024: OCaml has a built-in optional type to return Some value or None. Pretty basic, but I'm brand new to OCaml. I've always preferred not to use try/catch workflows - they are so non-idiomatic to me - but it works well here. Rewriting to exploit options is an eyesore (and doesn't work).
11/16/2024: Bluesky is a "Public Benefit Corporation" which is a designation indicating their objectives are not just profit but the "benefit of society".
11/17/2024: the fundamental principle of a zero knowledge proof. Basically one party proves to another that something is true (e.g. x = y) without revealing any information about x or y.
11/21/2024: a genuine understanding of random variables - in my graph theory course of all places (were doing probabilistic graph theory). I always knew how to use them in statistics classes, but never a real intuition for them as mathematical objects.
